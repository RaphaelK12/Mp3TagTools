<h1>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <b>Enter</b> key in any
of the ID3v1.1 or ID3v2.x tag fields as a shortcut to write the tags.
You can tag the files even while playing them!</li>
  <li>To select more than one file in the list using keyboard use <b>Ctrl+Shift+Up</b>
arrow or <b>Ctrl+Shift+Down</b> arrow after selecting an item.</li>
  <li>If you want to set the focus to the list from a ID3v1.1 or
ID3v2.x tag input field or vice versa use the <b>F4 </b>shortcut key<br>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to set the <b>Album</b>
tag of few mp3 files ripped from
the same Album, if one of the files has its <b>Album</b> tag correctly
named, then select all other files while pressing the <b>Ctrl</b> Key
and select the correctly named file last. This ensures that the last
file's tags
will be loaded into the tag information fields. Next disable all
tag fields except the <b>Album</b>
field then use <b>Ctrl+W</b> to write
the tags. You have just mass tagged several mp3s easily.</li>
  <li>To sort and view all the tracks from the same Album arranged in
ascending or descending order like 1,2,3..etc click on the header of
the <b>Album</b> column in the
program list.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Many mp3 tag editors out there write not only
junk characters
while mass tagging but some also write new ID3v1.1 tags by
increasing your mp3 file size by 128 bytes every time!! If you
suspect such a thing backup your tag data of that mp3 file then
use <b>Ctrl+Delete</b> to remove the
tags. If you still see tag entries for that
mp3 file then your suspicions proved to be right! Go on removing the
tags until the tag information fields show a totally empty tag or the
tag info column of the list displays "No ID3v1.1 Tag".</li>
  <li>To remove the organization of mp3s in subfolders and move
all
files to the parent folder, browse to the parent folder location,
check <b>Recurse subdirectories</b>
checkbox and load the mp3 list. Next select
all the files, then select "<b>..\</b>"
Directory Format and use the <b>Create
Directory</b> button.</li>
  <li>To use MTT as a mp3 hard drive search tool, use the
directory
button and select any one of your hard drives, make sure the <b>Recurse
subdirectories</b> checkbox is
checked. This will list all the
mp3s, then select any mp3 in the list and use <b>Ctrl+L</b> or <b>Open
File Location</b> to go to that
location.</li>
  <li>To use MTT as a virtual playlist do the same as above
then use <b>Ctrl+Enter</b> or <b>Play</b>
to play a file
then
subsequently use <b>Ctrl+Q</b> or <b>Enqueue
files in Winamp</b>. Listen to mp3s while
viewing all the mp3 info provided by MTT.</li>
  <li>If you would like to ensure that your mp3 contains no
extra
info (hidden info by some programs) in ID3v2.x tags (ID3v1.1
having a fixed size of 128 bytes this is not possible) or &nbsp;that
it contains non-ID3 obsolete tags like Lyrics3v2 tags, it is
recommended that you first use <b>Remove
tags</b> to remove
the ID3v2.x tags from all files. Next, set ID3v1.1 tags to
your liking then use <b>Copy
ID3v1.1---&gt;ID3v2.x</b> to set the clean
ID3v2.x data. Also use from the Tools
menu the <b>Remove all Non-ID3 Tags</b>
to remove all obsolete tags like
Lyrics3v2 from the end of the mp3 file (which is situated
between the ending audio data and the ID3v1.1 data). To learn
more about where these tags are situated in an mp3 file visit <a
